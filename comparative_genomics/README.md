<h2> 1. The Felsenstein's tree-pruning algorithm </h2>

The heuristic algorithm for computing the likelihood of an evolutionary tree from nucleic acid sequence data.
It is devoted to searching for an optimal tree structure.

<h2> 2. The Nearest-Neighbor Interchange (NNI) algorithm</h2>

Implementation of the NNI algorithm for rooted binary phylogenetic trees and using Jukes and Cantor substitution model.
It is one of the simplest tree-rearrangement methods.

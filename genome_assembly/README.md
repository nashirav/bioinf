Genome assembly
==================

<h2> De Bruijn Graph implementation with Eulerian walk-finder </h2>

Modern short-read assembly algorithms construct a de Bruijn graph by representing all k-mer prefixes and suffixes as nodes and then drawing edges that represent k-mers having a particular prefix and suffix [1].
Eulerian walk allows to reconstruct the DNA sequence from its fragments (k-mers).
